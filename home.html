	  <b>GHOST</b> 
	  <br>
	  <br>
	    It’s good to remember that things aren’t what they look like. 
	  <br>
	  	  <br>
	  Somebody dies. A group of people sit together for seven days in the living room of a suburban home. A truck in the driveway, couches and chairs and low stools around a coffee table. 
	   <br>
	  <br>
One person remembers many nights of love, another remembers trips to the cinema, another arguments and tension. Some people think about other people, dead and alive. Someone is annoyed, another person sad, another checks their phone for a work email, another is cranky, another goes out for bagels. They eat, there’s too much food. Sometimes they sing. The room is full of memories, but it is also full of what is in the room – the winter light, bowls of Doritos and two-liter bottles of Coke, cold cuts and crudités, ranch dressing. Someone’s coat thrown over the arm of the sofa. All this material situation, and none of it is exactly the person who has died, which is the reason they are all there, sitting together. 
 <br>
	  <br>
	  But as the days go on something else starts to happen. For one person there’s something blurry about the celery in the ranch dressing, for another the blue couch gets a bit raw and loaded, for someone else it’s the coming and going of cars in the driveway. Is that the same green Honda? Did it feel like that before? The past seems strange, missing, full of options. The future disappears. There’s no moment of arrival, absolutely nothing arrives, but at a certain point, no one can say any longer – what’s me, what’s you, what’s the couch, what are the cars, what is the living, what is the dead? 
 <br>
	  <br>
	      <br>
     The Rabbis in the Talmud can’t agree if the living can contact the dead or not. One says yes, but only in dreams. Another says it’s impossible, the dead are gone, only their material traces remain. Another says it is easy, but it is forbidden. Another says yes, but you should do it only in cases of absolute necessity. Another says there are 5000 dead on your right shoulder, and 10,000 on your left, but to see this would just be too overwhelming. 
 <br>
	  <br>
	  The dead aren’t images and aren’t memories and aren’t imagination and aren’t their traces in the material world and aren’t spirits or darkness or ghosts or the weight of history or even the dead but they aren’t not these things. It’s all tangled up. You can’t grab them or talk with them or resolve anything, but you can put your attention somewhere else, like on a song or a dance, and see what happens. Maybe it’s like those dim stars you can only see if you don’t look at them directly. 
 <br>
	  <br>
	  Walter Benjamin writes that Jews in the middle ages were forbidden from consulting oracles to look into the future because it gave the future too much power and magic. Instead the Torah instructs the Jews in remembrance, in mourning, in turning towards the past. It’s through this turning towards the past that each moment can become a gate through which something else might arrive. Unimaginable.

A Natural Language Processing Artificial Intelligence (AI) system is trained on thousands of pages of text. It makes a map of millions of words to learn how to use them. It uses this knowledge to generate responses to inputs. An archive processed through an algorithm, old words in a new order. 
 <br>
	  <br>
Artificial Intelligence is not intelligence but it is certainly artificial in the sense that it is built by humans. It is not a presence or a persona or a robot and not even necessarily a computer, and it is definitely not the non-human. 
 <br>
	  <br>
But it’s also not just a remix, because at the center of an AI system there is a black box, a process that can’t be traced or exactly predicted. 
 <br>
	  <br>
It’s Artificial Intelligence as a way to play with the presence of the past, with the dead who are always all over you. To put your fists in the archive, get it into your teeth.

It’s a new music dance performance called GHOST. It’s four people and it’s formal but it’s never quite the same. It’s singing words, words from the living and words from the dead, words that belong to no one, words connected to other words, words that traveled through time like the images in Warburg’s Atlas, words all the way to the 10,000 mile horizon. 
 <br>
	  <br>

We took books we loved connected to death and loss and memory and mourning, trained an AI system on them, and made music from the words it gave us. It sounds a little bit medieval and a little bit contemporary electronic and maybe too much 20th century America and it’s organized like dance and there are some dances too. It’s a New York uncle and his nephew and two friends but it’s not about family or friends, in fact it’s several hours to be none of those things but rather tend a field together without our names. 
 <br>
	  <br>


We’re never fully human, and anyways the dead aren’t gone (but not as ghosts or spirits or memories or anything like that). A rainbow hue, a book of texts, two suns in the sky, purple and silver, lots of round food, gold and brass, dim desert brown, definitely not a funeral. You can settle in, drop way down, let it wash over you, it’s serving, attending, being with forms so that something else might arrive, in the corner, over there, and it might last forever, but to find out you’ll just have to come and see…
